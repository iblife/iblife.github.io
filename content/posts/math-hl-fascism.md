If you are an IB student, you probably know what Mathematics HL (or Math Higher Level) is. It is a two-year course that covers topics such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics and complex numbers. It is also one of the most challenging and demanding courses in the IB curriculum, requiring hours of homework, practice and revision.

But did you know that Math HL can also turn you into a fascist?

That's right. According to a recent study by Dr. Xingping et al. from Tsinghua University, there is a strong correlation between taking Math HL and developing fascist tendencies. Dr. Xingping surveyed over 1000 IB students from different countries and backgrounds and found that those who took Math HL scored significantly higher on measures of authoritarianism, nationalism, xenophobia and intolerance than those who took other math courses or no math at all.

How can this be explained? Dr. Xingping has some theories.

First of all, he argues that Math HL fosters a sense of elitism and superiority among its students. They tend to look down on other subjects as inferior or irrelevant and view themselves as the chosen ones who can handle the rigor and complexity of Math HL. They also develop a strong loyalty to their fellow Math HL students and teachers, forming an exclusive clique that excludes others who do not share their passion for math.

Secondly, he claims that Math HL promotes a rigid and dogmatic way of thinking that discourages creativity and diversity. Math HL students are taught to follow strict rules and procedures to solve problems and prove theorems. They are expected to memorize formulas and definitions without questioning their validity or applicability. They are also exposed to only one perspective on math: the Western one. They rarely learn about the contributions of other cultures or civilizations to mathematics or how math can be used for social justice or environmental issues.

Thirdly, he suggests that Math HL induces a lot of stress and anxiety among its students which makes them more susceptible to extremist ideologies. Math HL students face constant pressure to perform well on tests and exams which account for most of their grades. They also have to deal with heavy workloads, tight deadlines and high expectations from themselves, their parents and their teachers. These factors can lead to feelings of frustration, anger, resentment and hopelessness which can make them more vulnerable to radicalization by groups or individuals who offer them simple solutions or scapegoats for their problems.

So what can we do about this alarming phenomenon? Dr. Xingping recommends some possible interventions:

- Introduce more diversity in the Math HL curriculum by including topics from different branches of mathematics such as geometry, topology, number theory or cryptography.
- Encourage more creativity in the Math HL classroom by allowing students to explore alternative methods or approaches to solve problems or prove theorems.
- Expose more Math HL students to other subjects such as literature, history, art or philosophy which can broaden their horizons and perspectives.
- Provide more support for Math HL students by offering them counseling services, peer mentoring programs or extracurricular activities which can help them cope with stress and anxiety.
- Educate more parents and teachers about the potential dangers of taking Math HL too seriously or pushing their children too hard.
- Monitor more closely any signs of radicalization among Math HL students such as expressing hateful views online or offline.

Mathematics is a beautiful subject that can enrich our lives in many ways but it should not become an obsession that isolates us from others or blinds us from reality.

Remember: Don't let Math HL turn you into a fascist!
