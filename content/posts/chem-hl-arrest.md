If you thought your IB Chemistry HL course was hard, wait until you hear about this student who took it to a whole new level. According to local news reports, a 17-year-old student from an international school in Singapore was arrested last week for possession of 1 tonnes of methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth.

The student, whose name has not been released for legal reasons, was allegedly involved in a large-scale drug trafficking operation that spanned across several countries in Southeast Asia. He was caught red-handed by the police when they raided his home and found a makeshift laboratory where he was producing and storing the illegal substance.

According to sources close to the investigation, the student claimed that he was using his IB Chemistry HL knowledge and skills to synthesize methamphetamine from common household chemicals and ingredients. He said that he was inspired by the popular TV show Breaking Bad, where a high school chemistry teacher turns into a drug lord.

The student also said that he was doing it as a way to cope with the stress and pressure of the IB program, which he described as "brutal" and "unfair". He said that he needed money to pay for his tuition fees, textbooks, CAS activities, IA experiments and TOK essays. He also said that he used some of the methamphetamine himself to stay awake and study for his exams.

The student's arrest has shocked and saddened his teachers, classmates and family members. They described him as a bright and talented young man who had a passion for chemistry and a promising future ahead of him. They said that they had no idea that he was involved in such a dangerous and illegal activity.

The student is currently facing several charges under Singapore's strict drug laws, which carry harsh penalties including life imprisonment or even death. His trial is expected to begin soon.

This is not the first time that an IB student has been caught up in a drug-related scandal. In 2019, two students from an international school in Hong Kong were arrested for smuggling cocaine into China using their EE binders. In 2020, a student from an international school in Switzerland was expelled for selling LSD tabs disguised as TOK stickers.

These incidents raise serious questions about the impact of the IB program on students' mental health and well-being. Some experts have suggested that the IB program is too demanding and stressful for young people who are still developing their cognitive and emotional skills. They have called for more support and guidance for IB students who may be struggling with academic or personal issues.

However, others have defended the IB program as a rigorous and rewarding educational experience that prepares students for success in life. They have argued that these cases are isolated incidents that do not reflect the majority of IB students who are responsible and law-abiding citizens. They have also pointed out that drug abuse is not exclusive to IB students but affects people from all walks of life.

What do you think? Is the IB program too hard or too easy? Do you know anyone who has done something illegal or unethical because of their IB studies?
