You might have even considered ending it all at some point. But before you do that, make sure you have taken Physics HL first.
That&rsquo;s what one IB student learned the hard way when he tried to hang himself from a ceiling fan using his CAS hours log as a rope.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/ib-suicide-fail/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/math-hl-fascism/>Rising fascism among IB Mathematics HL students</a></h1><time>Feb 27, 2023</time><br><div class=description>If you are an IB student, you probably know what Mathematics HL (or Math Higher Level) is. It is a two-year course that covers topics such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics and complex numbers. It is also one of the most challenging and demanding courses in the IB curriculum, requiring hours of homework, practice and revision.
But did you know that Math HL can also turn you into a fascist?&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/math-hl-fascism/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/stims-ib/>IB Students and Stimulant Use</a></h1><time>Feb 27, 2023</time><br><div class=description>If you are an IB student, chances are you have a secret stash of caffeine pills, energy drinks, or even stronger substances to help you survive the rigorous curriculum. A recent study by researchers at the University of Oxford has revealed that a staggering 99% of IB students are addicted to stimulants for staying awake.
The study surveyed over 10,000 IB students from around the world and asked them about their use of stimulants such as caffeine, nicotine, modafinil, Adderall, and Ritalin.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/stims-ib/>Read more ⟶</a></section></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2023 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
