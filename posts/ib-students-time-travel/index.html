A group of IB students from Singapore have reportedly built a time machine that allows them to study 40 hours a day.</p><p>The time machine, which resembles a large metal box with wires and buttons, was secretly constructed in the basement of the school library. According to one of the students involved, who wished to remain anonymous, the device works by creating a temporal loop that repeats the same 24 hours over and over again.</p><p>&ldquo;We figured out that if we enter the time machine at midnight and set it to loop back to midnight, we can effectively study for 40 hours in one day,&rdquo; the student explained. &ldquo;We only need to exit the loop before midnight on the next day, otherwise we would be stuck in an infinite cycle.&rdquo;</p><p>The student claimed that they and their friends have been using the time machine for several months now, and have seen significant improvements in their grades and test scores. They also said that they have not experienced any negative side effects from altering the flow of time.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, we are careful not to change anything in the past or interact with our past selves,&rdquo; the student said. &ldquo;We also make sure to eat and sleep regularly inside the loop. We don&rsquo;t want to mess up anything or cause any paradoxes.&rdquo;</p><p>However, not everyone is impressed by this feat of engineering and academic achievement. Some of their classmates and teachers have expressed doubts and concerns about the ethics and legality of using a time machine for studying purposes.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s cheating,&rdquo; said another IB student who was not involved in the project. &ldquo;They are gaining an unfair advantage over other students who work hard without manipulating time. They should be disqualified from taking exams or receiving diplomas.&rdquo;</p><p>A teacher who teaches IB subjects also questioned the validity and reliability of using a time machine for learning outcomes.</p><p>&ldquo;How can we trust that they actually learned anything?&rdquo; the teacher asked. &ldquo;How do we know that they didn&rsquo;t just memorize answers or copy from sources? How do we measure their skills and competencies? How do we ensure quality assurance?&rdquo;</p><p>The teacher also warned that using a time machine could have serious consequences for both individuals and society.</p><p>&ldquo;Time travel is a dangerous and unpredictable phenomenon,&rdquo; the teacher said. &ldquo;It could create temporal anomalies, distort reality, or even destroy space-time itself. It could also affect history, culture, politics, economics, environment, etc. It could change everything we know and love.&rdquo;</p><p>The teacher urged anyone who has access to a time machine to stop using it immediately and report it to authorities.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth risking your life or your future for some extra hours of studying,&rdquo; the teacher said. &ldquo;There are better ways to achieve your goals than messing with time.&rdquo;</p><p>However, despite these warnings and criticisms, some IB students are still curious about trying out the time machine for themselves.</p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s awesome,&rdquo; said another IB student who wanted to join the project. &ldquo;I would love to study 40 hours a day. I would learn so much more than I do now. I would ace all my exams and get into any university I want.&rdquo;</p><p>The student added that they were not afraid of any potential risks or consequences.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about paradoxes or anomalies,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;I just care about getting good grades.&rdquo;</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2023 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
