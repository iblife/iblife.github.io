A recent study by researchers at the University of Oxford has revealed that a staggering 99% of IB students are addicted to stimulants for staying awake.</p><p>The study surveyed over 10,000 IB students from around the world and asked them about their use of stimulants such as caffeine, nicotine, modafinil, Adderall, and Ritalin. The results showed that only 1% of IB students reported never using any stimulants at all. The rest admitted to using them at least once a week, with some using them daily or even multiple times a day.</p><p>The researchers attributed this alarming trend to the high expectations and demands of the IB programme. According to their website, &ldquo;IB students often perform better&rdquo; and &ldquo;develop strong academic, social and emotional characteristics&rdquo;. They also claim that IB students are &ldquo;inquirers&rdquo;, &ldquo;knowledgeable&rdquo;, &ldquo;thinkers&rdquo;, &ldquo;communicators&rdquo;, &ldquo;principled&rdquo;, &ldquo;open-minded&rdquo;, &ldquo;caring&rdquo;, &ldquo;risk-takers&rdquo;, &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; and &ldquo;reflective&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a lot of pressure for anyone!</p><p>The study also found that IB students suffer from higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and burnout than their non-IB peers. Many IB students reported feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do, such as assignments, projects, essays, presentations, exams, CAS activities (creativity-action-service), TOK (theory-of-knowledge), EE (extended essay), etc. Some even said they have no time for hobbies or social life.</p><p>The researchers warned that this reliance on stimulants could have serious consequences for the health and well-being of IB students. They recommended that IB schools should provide more support and guidance for their students on how to cope with stress and manage their time effectively. They also suggested that IB students should seek professional help if they feel they have a problem with substance abuse.</p><p>So what can you do if you are an IB student who is addicted to stimulants? Here are some tips:</p><p>- Try to reduce your intake gradually. Don&rsquo;t go cold turkey as this could cause withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>- Replace your stimulants with healthier alternatives such as water, fruit juice, herbal tea or decaf coffee.</p><p>- Get enough sleep every night. Aim for at least eight hours if possible.</p><p>- Exercise regularly. This will boost your mood and energy levels naturally.</p><p>- Eat a balanced diet. Avoid junk food and sugar which can make you crash later.</p><p>- Relax your mind and body. Do some meditation, yoga or breathing exercises.</p><p>- Talk to someone you trust. Share your feelings and concerns with a friend, family member or counselor.</p><p>Remember: You do<del>n&rsquo;t</del> need stimulants to succeed in the IB programme! You have what it takes</p><p>to achieve your goals without compromising your health!</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2023 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
