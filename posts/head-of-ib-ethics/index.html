You might have wondered if it is really worth it to sacrifice your sleep, social life and sanity for a diploma that is supposed to open doors for your future. You might have even questioned the ethics of a programme that expects you to juggle six subjects, an extended essay, a theory of knowledge course and a creativity, activity and service project while maintaining a high level of academic performance.</p><p>Well, wonder no more. The head of IBDP has recently published a groundbreaking paper that proves that it is actually ethical to ruin students&rsquo; mental health for the sake of education. In his paper, he argues that the IBDP is not only beneficial for students&rsquo; intellectual development but also for their moral character. He claims that by exposing students to extreme levels of challenge and difficulty, the IBDP fosters resilience, perseverance and courage in them. He also asserts that by making students face ethical dilemmas and global issues in their studies, the IBDP cultivates empathy, compassion and responsibility in them.</p><p>The head of IBDP further defends his position by citing several studies that show that suffering can lead to happiness in the long run. He cites research that suggests that people who experience adversity are more likely to appreciate what they have and find meaning in their lives. He also cites research that indicates that people who endure hardship are more likely to develop gratitude and optimism. He concludes his paper by stating that the IBDP is not only ethical but also humane because it prepares students for the harsh realities of life and helps them grow as individuals.</p><p>The paper has received mixed reactions from the academic community and the public. Some have praised it as a brilliant piece of scholarship that sheds new light on the value and purpose of education. Others have criticized it as a flawed and biased attempt to justify an abusive and oppressive system. Some have even called it a satire or a hoax because they could not believe that someone would seriously make such claims.</p><p>As for me, I am not convinced by his arguments at all. I think he is ignoring or downplaying the negative effects of stress on students&rsquo; physical and mental health. I think he is overlooking or dismissing the alternative ways of achieving educational excellence without compromising students&rsquo; well-being. I think he is rationalizing or glorifying an unfair and cruel programme that exploits students&rsquo; potential instead of nurturing it.</p><p>But hey, maybe I&rsquo;m just bitter because I&rsquo;m one of those poor souls who has to suffer through this programme every day. Maybe I&rsquo;m just jealous because he gets to sit in his comfortable office while writing papers while I have to stay up all night writing essays while crying tears of blood.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2023 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
