You might have even considered ending it all at some point. But before you do that, make sure you have taken Physics HL first.</p><p>That&rsquo;s what one IB student learned the hard way when he tried to hang himself from a ceiling fan using his CAS hours log as a rope. Unfortunately for him, he had not studied enough physics to calculate the tension, torque and angular momentum of the system. As a result, his makeshift rope snapped under his weight and he landed on his bed with a loud thud.</p><p>His parents rushed into his room and found him lying on the floor with a sheet of paper around his neck. They were shocked and confused by what they saw. They asked him what he was doing and why he had such a strange document around his neck.</p><p>He explained that he was trying to kill himself because he couldn&rsquo;t handle the stress of IB anymore. He said that he had used his CAS hours log as a rope because it was the only thing that made him feel accomplished in life. He said that he had spent hundreds of hours doing various activities such as volunteering at an orphanage, teaching English to refugees, playing chess with senior citizens and knitting sweaters for kids.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2023 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
