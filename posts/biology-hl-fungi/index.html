According to sources, the student (who wishes to remain anonymous) was so distraught by missing one point on his Biology HL paper that he decided to take revenge on his school by spreading a deadly fungus among his classmates and teachers.</p><p>The fungus in question is Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), also known as the chytrid fungus, which is responsible for wiping out hundreds of amphibian species around the world. Bd infects the skin of frogs and other amphibians, causing them to lose water and electrolytes and eventually die from cardiac arrest.</p><p>How did the student get his hands on such a lethal microbe? Apparently, he had been working on a research project on Bd for his extended essay, and had access to a culture of the fungus in his school&rsquo;s laboratory. He claims that he was fascinated by the fungus&rsquo;s ability to evade the immune system of its hosts and form complex networks of actin filaments. He also admits that he was curious about how Bd would affect humans, since there have been no reported cases of human infection so far.</p><p>The student says that he smuggled some of the fungus out of the lab and sprinkled it on various surfaces around the school, such as door handles, water fountains, keyboards, and cafeteria trays. He hoped that by doing so, he would infect some of his peers and teachers who had annoyed him or given him low marks. He did not expect that Bd would be so contagious and virulent in humans as well.</p><p>Within days, dozens of people at the school started showing symptoms of fungal infection: fever, rash, blisters, peeling skin, difficulty breathing. Some even developed neurological problems such as seizures and hallucinations. The school was quickly quarantined by health authorities who traced the source of the outbreak to Bd. They were shocked to discover that this was not an isolated incident: similar cases were reported in other parts of the country and even abroad.</p><p>It turns out that Bd can spread through airborne droplets after an infected person sneezes or coughs, just like measles. This means that anyone who came into contact with someone from the school could have been exposed to Bd. The fungus also has a long incubation period: up to two weeks before symptoms appear. This means that many people could have been infected without knowing it.</p><p>As of now, there is no cure or vaccine for Bd infection in humans. The only treatment available is antifungal drugs which have limited efficacy and serious side effects. The mortality rate is estimated at 50%, making Bd one of the deadliest pathogens ever encountered by humanity.</p><p>The student who started this fungal apocalypse has expressed remorse for his actions. He says that he never intended to harm anyone seriously or cause such widespread devastation. He says that he was just angry and frustrated by his exam result and wanted to vent his feelings. He says that he regrets being so obsessed with perfectionism and academic achievement.</p><p>He also says that he hopes that his story will serve as a warning for other students who are under pressure from their parents or teachers or themselves to excel at all costs. He says that there are more important things in life than grades: such as health, happiness, friendship&mldr;and survival.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2023 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
